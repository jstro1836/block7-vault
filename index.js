//Pseudo code for Block 7 is below

/*
Step 1: Declare three constant numeric variables assigned the values of 10, 40, and 39 using arithmentic operators
Step 2: Declare a string variable saying "You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault"
Step 3: Create a pop up dialog that displays the string and numberic values
*/

// Declaring the constant variable num1 and using multiplication to assign a value of 10 
const num1 = 5 * 2; 

// Declaring the constant variable num2 and using division to assign a value of 40 
const num2 = 400 / 10; 

// Declaring the constant variable num3 and using addition to assign a value of 39 
const num3 = 25 + 14; 

// Declaring the constant variable userMessage and assigning string text 
const userMessage = "You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination: "; 

// Creating a popup dialog that alerts the user to open the vault providing the secret codes 10, 40, 39
alert(userMessage + num1 + "-" + num2 + "-" + num3);
